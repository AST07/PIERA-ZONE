PIERA-ZONE is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) that makes it easier for educators to conduct fair digital exams for FREE with an easy to use interface and clear workflow of the entire process from creation, conduction, evaluation to sharing and working with results. It has been created by keeping individual use in mind, but we do provide a basic setup for an institution with a basic hierarchy who would like to have a login and log of user activity.
