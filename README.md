# PIERA-ZONE
PIERA-ZONE is a digital examination software, which makes conducting exams easy and free. By free we mean both free of cost and free of malpractices.

PIERA-ZONE has been created by keeping individual use in mind, but we do provide a basic setup for an institution with a basic hierarchy who would like to have a login and log of user activity.
