PIERA-ZONE is a free digital examination tool which enables you to conduct professional and robust exams, free of malpractices with minimal hassle.

PIERA-ZONE has been created by keeping individual use in mind, but we do provide a basic setup for an institution with a basic hierarchy who would like to have a login and log of user activity.
