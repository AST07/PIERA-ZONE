PIERA-ZONE is a free digital examination tool which enables you to conduct professional and robust exams, free of malpractices with minimal hassle. It has been created by keeping individual use in mind, but we do provide a basic setup for an institution with a basic hierarchy who would like to have a login and log of user activity. PIERA-ZONE makes it easier for the educators to conduct fair exams with an easy to use interface and clean workflow of the entire process from creation, conduction, evaluation to sharing and working with the results.
